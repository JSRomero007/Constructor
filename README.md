# Constructor

# **Description**:

A project developed in C# that automatically detects the presence of a specific folder on a USB device when connected. The system monitors the device in real-time, allowing immediate identification of the folder to execute predefined actions efficiently and automatically.

# **Challenges and Solutions**:

One of the main challenges was that the folder on the USB could be highly variable and sometimes different in structure or content. To address this, the system was designed to automatically detect and extract the relevant information from the folder, regardless of its variations. The extracted data is then saved in a specific path on the C: drive, ensuring consistent storage and organization of the information.

# **Role and Responsibilities**:

Collaborated on the development of the Constructor project, focusing on designing and implementing an automated system for detecting folders on USB devices. Worked with the team to optimize performance and ensure smooth and efficient integration.
